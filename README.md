# JOSM-Parking-Lane-Style

This is an update to the [JOSM Parking Lane Style](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Styles/ParkingLanes), adapted to the new [street parking schema](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/street_parking_revision).

**Changes:**
+ Support for new street parking tags
+ The parking position is symbolised by an indicated kerb line
+ Deprecated tags are highlighted by their own warning style, the old attributes are still shown at the same time
* Slight adjustments of some other styles and colours
